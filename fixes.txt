should be done:
1. shared types (FE && BE) - V
2. game logic not working properly (FE && BE) - V
3. remove duplicate code / unused code (FE && BE) (game controller removed) - V
4. move to svg files, add svgr vite (FE)
5. create constant for the number of the leadboard list (now its 10) (BE)
6. create README file
7. error boundry
8. check that all the types are in the types folders (and relevant interfaces)
